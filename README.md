# Open GitHub PRs in new tabs
This extension does what the title says it does, no more, no less. 
When you are on the PR list page for GitHub, clicking the icon will open every PR on that page in a new tab.

## Use Case
I review a lot of PRs, so opening them one at a time, reviewing them, 
then going back to the list to select a new one is inefficient for me. 
Up till now I manually opened each PR in the list in a new tab then started reviewing, 
closing the tab when I was done and moving on to the next tab. 
Manually opening the PRs was annoying hence this extension.

## Usage
1. Open your PR list page `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/pulls/review-requested/<user>`.
2. Click the icon.
3. You're done.

## Notes
This will work on the PRs and Issues page.

### TODOs
1. limit to only activate on GitHub 
1. Change the icon
1. Publish to chrome store
1. ...
1. Profit
